## 2026-09-07 13:25 — Session 1: system exploration via connectors, no code

Intent:    Read CLAUDE.md and README.md, confirm the Slack / Google Drive / n8n
           connectors are attached, and build a first-hand picture of the engine
           from the live systems rather than from the spec alone. Explicitly no
           code this session.

Files:     BUILD_LOG.md (created — this file). No other changes.

### Connectors

Confirmed attached and enabled: **n8n**, **Slack**, **Google Drive**. Also
present in this workspace and enabled: Airtable, Notion, Sprouts. Not enabled:
Gmail, Google Calendar, Fireflies, Latenode.

All three required connectors returned live data. Nothing was modified anywhere —
n8n reads only, no Slack posts, no Drive writes.

### What the engine actually looks like

**n8n** — 62 workflows on `https://n8n.arupiautomates.cloud/`. The three
subsystems named in the spec are each a front door plus a set of subworkflows:

| Subsystem | Front door | Webhook | Error workflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bays | `Bays` (iEiBm8vn3JANZRR2) | `POST /webhook/bays` | Bays — Error Handler |
| Research Twin | `Research Twin` (9WiMmxrD74uAlc2H) | `POST /webhook/research-twin` | Research Twin — Error Handler |
| North Star | `North Star` (7MIlqO3IDCdno7PY) | `POST /webhook/north-star` | North Star — Error Handler |

All three share one front-door pattern: parse and classify the Slack payload →
dedupe on Slack `event_id` → loop-guard on `session_id` (30s TTL window, added
Aug 27 against Genie ↔ RT/NS bounce loops) → route. Bays routes to seven
destinations (`app_home`, `slash_command`, `submit`, `message_check`, `agent`,
`onboarding`, `callback_answer`); RT routes to three (`app_home`, `agent`,
`card_research`); NS routes to two (`app_home`, `agent`).

Each conversational agent sits behind a Tools Router. The routers are the real
data contract:

- **RT — Tools Router** (10 tools): `read_research_queue`, `write_research_finding`,
  `post_to_slack`, `send_callback_answer`, `compute_lane_state`,
  `write_commercial_card_fields`, `queue_followup_research`,
  `update_watched_client_question`, `create_client_report_doc`, `search_workspace`.
- **NS — Tools Router** (6 tools): `Get_Priority_Evidence`, `Query_North_Star_Cluster`,
  `Get_Capacity_Status`, `Send_Callback_Answer`, `Post_Answer_To_Slack`,
  `Read_Open_Loops`.

Storage, as read off the router nodes:

- Airtable bases: **BHA Research Queue** / Research Queue, **BHA Commercial
  Opportunities**, **Priority Ledger**, **Lane_status**, plus a watched-clients
  base (`appkSUSh9ijNjP2f8`) and a capped/reviewed table (`app4QnMJ2woiKlLc0`).
- **Open loops live in `appUVlBSGGPHw6DGh`, one table per builder** — Destiny,
  Jason, Kaiqi, Jegan, Ahad, Hardik, Kavin. `Read_Open_Loops` fans out across
  all seven with hardcoded table IDs, then merges.
- BHARAG2 at `https://bharag2.duckdns.org` — `/api/v1/cluster/ask`,
  `/api/v1/ingest`, `/api/v1/ingest/batch`, and the incident ledger at
  `/api/v1/incidents`, `GET /api/v1/incidents`, `POST /api/v1/incidents/:id/status`.

**Incidents.** The Bays Error Handler is the engine-wide catch: any workflow
naming it as its Error Workflow routes failures here. Flow is classify (Claude
via OpenRouter, five classes: `BILLING_QUOTA`, `NETWORK_TIMEOUT`,
`SCHEMA_VALIDATION`, `CONFIG_AUTH`, `UNKNOWN`) → check the last 24h for a repeat
of the same workflow + node → decide retryability (billing, config/auth and
schema never auto-retry) → open or transition an incident in the BHARAG ledger →
alert `#bha-pipeline-errors`. Retry policy on the payload is
`{ retryable, max_retries: 3, retry_interval: '5m', retries_attempted }`.
Subsystem is computed deterministically from workflow name and node prefix into
`CODEX`, `CHANNELARCHIVES`, `COMMERCIALOPPS`, `BUILDPATTERNS` or `AGENT` — the
server rejects underscores in `subsystem` (`INCIDENT_INVALID_SUBSYSTEM`) and
allocates the canonical `entity_id` itself.

**Slack** — `#bha-coordination`, `#workflow-logs-<builder>`, `#bha-pipeline-errors`,
`#bha-engine-alerts`, `#bha-daily-checkin`, `#bha-log-reviews`, `#bha-weekly-checkin`.

**Drive** — the contract library is real and readable. Most relevant to this
build: *BHA Build Pattern — Incident-to-Pay Loop v1 (RT / North Star / Logstream
Reference Contract)*, *Contract — Self-Healing Contract v1*, *BHA Build Pattern —
Alert Delivery v1*, *BHA_Narration_Guidance_v1.1.pdf*.

Problem:   No build problems — nothing was built. Four findings that block or
           change the Phase 1 fixture design:

           1. There is no state history to render. Destiny, in
              `#workflow-logs-destiny` on 2026-09-04, verbatim:
              "We have no engine-side history. Airtable rows overwrite in place,
              Codex entries are snapshots, RT and NS emit nothing. The only
              system with real state history is the incident ledger."
              Telemetry v1 and self-healing v1 started this week (Monday
              2026-09-07) and are Destiny's current primary objective.

           2. `evidence_shape_version` — required by CLAUDE.md §7 on the NS/RT
              Records tab — does not appear in the RT Tools Router at all, and is
              named in Slack (2026-09-06, Jason) as a *gap*: "the missing
              job-record/evidence_shape_version gap tied to autopay rule two."

           3. The four vFarm event types in CLAUDE.md §7
              (`burn_in_cycle_started`, `burn_in_anomaly`,
              `growth_cycle_started`, `growth_cycle_measurement_logged`) do not
              match what vFarm emits. Jegan, `#bha-coordination` 2026-09-07:
              vFarm writes to BHARAG ledger corpora, not documents —
              `vfarm.sensor` (3-minute place rollups: pH, temperature,
              humidity), `vfarm.alert` (threshold alerts, incident closes),
              `vfarm.vision`, via `POST /api/v1/ingest/batch`. Readiness is
              expected to surface at `/clusters/:id/readiness`, which per the
              Incident-to-Pay contract is not yet built.

           4. Open loops are mid-migration and currently inconsistent. Destiny's
              table alone: 311 total, 41 closed, 2 in progress, 268 open
              (2026-09-06). Two TEMP workflows dated Sept 5 exist to reclassify
              and repair misrouted loops. Live example today, 2026-09-07 in
              `#workflow-logs-kaiqi`: the digest told Kaiqi he had 3 open loops;
              `Read_My_Open_Loops` against his table returned 0.

Fix:       Not applicable — exploration only.

Decision:  1. Recorded the router tool lists and Airtable/BHARAG surfaces above
              as the starting point for the Phase 1 fixture shapes, so the mock
              contract is drawn from what the engine actually exposes rather than
              invented. Per CLAUDE.md §4 the mock shapes become the contract, so
              they should be derived, not guessed.
           2. Did not resolve the four findings above unilaterally. They are
              scope questions under CLAUDE.md §2 rule 5 and go to Destiny before
              any fixture is written.
           3. Did not write any code, per the session instruction.

Security:  Flagged, not changed. Two live service API keys are hardcoded in
           plaintext inside `Parse & Classify Event` code nodes — one in
           `Research Twin` (9WiMmxrD74uAlc2H), one in `North Star`
           (7MIlqO3IDCdno7PY). Both are the `x-api-key` gate for external asks.
           They are readable by anyone with n8n workflow read access and by any
           MCP client attached to this n8n instance. The RT one carries a comment
           saying it was rotated Aug 29 to the "locked 6-secret architecture."
           The values are deliberately not reproduced here, and nothing in this
           repo references them. Raised with Destiny in session; the fix is
           n8n credentials or environment variables, not a code node, and it is
           Destiny's call, not this repo's.

Blocked:   `BHA - log_engine_event` (j4gD7onkPGLadFBY) could not be read — n8n
           returned "Workflow is not available in MCP. Enable MCP access in
           workflow settings." Given the name, it is likely the telemetry writer
           and therefore directly relevant to this dashboard's data contract.
           Needs `availableInMCP` enabled before the next session.

Not done:  BUILD_LOG.md was not uploaded to Google Drive this session (CLAUDE.md
           §9). Holding until Destiny confirms the target folder.
